    Calculates the maximum rate that O2 can be diffused into a cell

    Parameters
    ----------
    diam : Float
        equivalent spherical diatmeter of the microbe (um)
    Qc : Float
        carbon quota of a single cell (mol C / um^3)
    C_to_N : Float
        carbon to nitrogen ratio of the microbes biomass
    
    Returns
    -------
    po_coef : Float
        The maximum rate of O2 diffusion into the cell in units of m^3 / mmol N / day

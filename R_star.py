    Parameters
    ----------
    loss : TYPE
        rate of loss of biomass
    K_r : TYPE
        half-saturation coefficient for uptake
    Vmax : TYPE
        Maximum uptake rate of molecule
    y_r : TYPE
        Yield of biomass creation (mol BioN per mol compound)

    Returns
    -------
    TYPE
        R* = the subsistence concentration of the compound in question required to sustain biomass
